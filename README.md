# Momotalk Simulator

## Special Thanks

This project is basically a recovery of Yuzutalk which was suddenly closed months ago. Thanks to [Yuzutalk](https://github.com/yuzutalk) who was the initiator of original project, and [Hankyu2000](https://github.com/Hankyu2000) who gave the emergency archive but in obfuscated. Finally, [Ionqie](https://github.com/lonqie), the maintainer of [SchaleDB](https://github.com/lonqie/SchaleDB), selflessly shared data to open source.
